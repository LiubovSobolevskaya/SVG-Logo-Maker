## Desciption
This is a computer program that you can use by typing commands into a terminal. When you use the program, it will ask you for some information. You can type up to three letters, choose a color, and select a shape from a list of options. Once you've provided all the information, the program will create a picture called "logo.svg" and display a message that says "Generated logo.svg". You can open the picture in a web browser and it will be 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall. It will look like the picture you described when you gave the program all the information.
